**flutter_etu** is an educational project that I organized to structure my learning of Flutter. I have divided this project into multiple branches, each covering a specific theme or concept in Flutter. This allows me to easily navigate between topics and explore different features and development approaches in Flutter.

## Project Structure

Each branch of the repository corresponds to a theme or course module. To switch between topics, simply change branches and review the corresponding code and files. Here are some examples of branches and their content:

- `gridview`: Learning grid display with the `GridView` widget.
- `listview`: Exploring list display using the `ListView` widget.
- `etat`: State management with examples using `setState` and advanced state management approaches.
- `navigation`: Implementing navigation between pages using `Navigator` and `routes`.
- `provider`: Setting up state management for better separation of responsibilities and optimal reactivity.
- `routes`: Configuring and using routes for organized and maintainable navigation.

**Note**: This list is not exhaustive, and additional branches are available to cover more Flutter concepts.

## How to Use the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naelbenaissa/flutter_etu.git
   cd flutter_etu
   ```
2. **Switch between branches**:
   Each branch corresponds to a specific theme:
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   Ensure dependencies are installed and launch the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## Technologies and Tools

- **Flutter**: The main framework used to build cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Dependencies**: Each branch may contain specific dependencies, which can be found in `pubspec.yaml`.
